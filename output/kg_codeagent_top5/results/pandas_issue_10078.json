Any logic that wrongly infers a column as a Timestamp instead of keeping its original string/integer type must be addressed here. 2. pandas/core/groupby/generic.py contains the public-facing SeriesGroupBy and DataFrameGroupBy classes and their groupby-apply logic, potentially wrapping/customizing result post-processing and type inference for grouped operations. 3. pandas/core/frame.py contains the DataFrame.groupby method and is the entry point for DataFrame groupby operations; it may handle construction of result objects and apply logic. 4. pandas/core/series.py contains the Series.groupby method and logic that could be relevant if groupby/apply is called on Series; also, Series construction methods may invoke type-detection utilities that should preserve string types instead of converting to Timestamp. 5. pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py is a key utility file for type casting and construction inside pandas. If string-to-Timestamp coercion is happening unexpectedly, generic logic here (potentially invoked by groupby/apply output construction) needs to be checked to ensure it doesn't over-aggressively infer time-like types from strings. These files collectively cover the flow from public API to groupby/apply machinery and the dtype preservation or conversion layers most directly relevant to the issue.\"\n}",
