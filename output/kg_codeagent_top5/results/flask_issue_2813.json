Modification here enables flexible routing for multiple domains as required by the issue. 2. src/flask/ctx.py: Handles request and app context creation, may need changes for context propagation of routing logic and adapter creation to align with SERVER_NAME usage. 3. src/flask/config.py: In charge of configuration; changes may be required to better document, validate, or manipulate SERVER_NAME for advanced use cases. 4. tests/test_request.py: Should be updated or created to verify correct routing and URL generation behaviors under multiple host scenarios as described in the issue. 5. tests/test_regression.py: Provides additional coverage to ensure previous routing behaviors remain intact after the fix, prevents regressions.'}",
