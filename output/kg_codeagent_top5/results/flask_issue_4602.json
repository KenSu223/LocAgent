This file needs modification so _find_package_path can use import_name for correct namespace package resolution.\\n2. src/flask/app.py defines Flask.auto_find_instance_path; coordination or adaptation may be required here to use the improved find_package logic.\\n3. tests/test_instance_config.py should be modified or expanded to include tests for correct behavior of instance_path in complex namespace and development setups.\\n4. tests/test_basic.py may need updates if instance_path or namespace package behavior is covered there or if additional sanity tests are required.'}",
