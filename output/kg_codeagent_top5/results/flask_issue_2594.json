To enable --ssl_context, its option parsing for 'flask run' must be modified to accept this argument and pass it to Flask.run(). The lack of direct string matches suggests indirect decoration or dynamic registration, but it remains the canonical CLI module.\\n2. flask/app.py: The Flask.run() method resides here. It already accepts 'ssl_context', but modifications may be required to ensure the parameter can be consumed if passed indirectly from the CLI or to update signatures or help text.\\n3. docs/cli.rst: Documentation needs updating to mention the new --ssl_context flag and any resulting usage patterns for HTTPS with 'flask run'.\\n4. tests/test_cli.py: Tests validating CLI behavior must be updated/created to verify that 'flask run --ssl_context=adhoc' works and errors if an invalid value is provided.\\n\\nIf further indirection is discovered (e.g., in __main__.py or helpers), those could be added, but based on repo conventions and the issue scope, these four files should be targeted.\"\n}",
