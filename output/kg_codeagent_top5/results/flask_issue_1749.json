  "raw_output": "{'files_to_modify': ['flask/json.py'], 'reasoning': 'The issue with ignoring timezone information in datetime serialization for JSON encoding is handled exclusively by the JSONEncoder class in flask/json.py. Specifically, the default() method uses http_date(o.timetuple()), which does not preserve timezone info. Modifying flask/json.py to correctly handle timezone-aware datetime objects addresses the root cause. No other files in the direct flask codebase process datetime objects for JSON, as confirmed by exhaustive searches.'}",
