This is the primary location for investigating memory leaks related to object lifecycle, fit logic, and references held during fit and after deletion. 2. sklearn/linear_model/base.py contains the mixin base classes that LogisticRegression inherits from (LinearClassifierMixin, SparseCoefMixin) and could be holding resources inadvertently through the inheritance hierarchy. 3. sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py may hold supporting routines or alternate paths for LogisticRegression if _logistic.py mainly handles import/export; it's a common pattern for legacy support and core solver logic. 4. sklearn/linear_model/sag_fast.pyx implements the SAG solver logic used for fast convergence in various linear models, including LogisticRegression. Memory leaks often originate from cython/C code due to missing deallocation, especially in the context of repeated fitting and deletion. 5. sklearn/linear_model/sgd_fast.pyx is another Cython-implemented solver, used for SGD variants, which could affect memory retention in LogisticRegression if chosen as a solver or through shared utility allocations. Focusing on these files will most likely reveal logic responsible for any resource mismanagement in fit/del cycles.\"\n}",
