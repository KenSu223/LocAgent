Handles how input features (token_type_ids, etc.) are processed and interacts with model card loading\u2014central to both errors described. 2. src/transformers/modelcard.py: Responsible for downloading/loading model cards. Generates warnings and empty cards when unable to fetch from server, per the issue description. 3. src/transformers/data/processors/squad.py: Contains SQuAD data processing; manages token_type_ids and might be the source of missing/incorrect feature dicts leading to KeyError in the pipeline. 4. src/transformers/tokenization_xlm_roberta.py: Implements logic for generating or managing token_type_ids during tokenization; changes here may resolve cases where token_type_ids are not generated as expected. 5. src/transformers/__init__.py: Connects pipeline API to user, ensuring correct imports and exposure of the main `pipeline` function; update only if interface needs adjusting.'}",
