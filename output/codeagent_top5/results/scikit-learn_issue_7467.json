Needs update to cast float 'step' to integer/slice safely, ensuring proper support for float step values as per documentation.\\n2. sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_rfe.py: Unit tests exercising RFECV and RFE with 'step', ensuring correct behavior for float input, as well as regression testing for previous warning case.\\n3. doc/modules/feature_selection.rst: Documentation chronicling use of RFECV/RFE and the 'step' parameter, which should explicitly document correct float support and examples for users.\\n4. examples/feature_selection/plot_rfe_with_cross_validation.py: Example code using RFECV, which may include sample runs of float 'step', ensuring reproducibility and correct demonstration after the fix.\\n5. sklearn/feature_selection/rfe.py (again if shared): If the file contains both RFECV and RFE logic (likely), ensure changes cover feature elimination loop in both, as needed.\"}",
