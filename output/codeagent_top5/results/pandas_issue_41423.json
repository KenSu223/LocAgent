The most important file is pandas/core/series.py, which contains the implementation and class docstring for pandas.Series. The lack of information about the 'copy' parameter is best resolved by adding or improving its description in the Series class or constructor docstring, as Sphinx pulls this directly for the API reference.\\n\\n2. The second file is doc/source/reference/series.rst, which is the primary documentation stub for the Series API in the user-facing docs. This file should reference all parameters and explain 'copy' clearly in its summary or autodoc directive if not already present.\\n\\n3. The third file is doc/source/reference/index.rst, which aggregates and summarizes main API objects and may reference or summarize parameters for Series. If the parameter description or summary appears here, it should also be updated for consistency.\\n\\nNo other files need modification unless further documentation, cheatsheets, or user guides (not shown as relevant in the issue) reference the Series constructor parameters.\"\n}",
