The unclear documentation quoted in the issue is found in method/class docstrings here. To clarify what happens when None is passed (that it is treated as 0), the docstring for the __init__ method, and possibly other related docstrings handling compression, should be updated. If the decision is to change the actual default, that would also be implemented here.\",\n        \"2. doc/source/reference/io.rst: This file likely contains the primary API reference documentation for IO functions and classes, including HDFStore and its compression arguments. Any clarification regarding the behavior of 'complevel' defaults, or updates mirroring the improved docstrings, should be made here.\",\n        \"3. doc/source/user_guide/io.rst: The user guide offers higher-level explanations, examples, and usage hints. To make the behavior of 'complevel=None' clear to end users, the relevant section discussing HDFStore or compression should be updated for consistency and clarity. This is less critical than the reference file, but important for overall documentation transparency.\"\n    ]\n}",
