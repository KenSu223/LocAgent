Expanding and synchronizing its 'Sprints' section will directly resolve the issue described.\\n2. doc/whats_new/older_versions.rst: May contain sprints-related historical notes; updating here ensures completeness for past events.\\n3. doc/developers/contributing.rst: References handling of PRs from sprints; update if contribution guidelines are clarified or changed in relation to sprint events.\\n4. doc/developers/bug_triaging.rst: Guidance around PRs from sprints; update for better process visibility if needed.\\n5. doc/conf.py: Only if automating the pulling or rendering of sprints from external sources (e.g., syncing with blog), update the Sphinx config accordingly.\"}",
