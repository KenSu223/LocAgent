The issue requires logic change in this file to ensure Flask ignores a .env directory and only warns about actual files. 2. flask/helpers.py: Environment-related helpers (such as get_env or get_load_dotenv) are imported from here and may be involved in the detection logic, so any file/directory check helpers that are shared should be updated to differentiate files from directories. 3. tests/test_cli.py: The CLI test suite should be updated to include test cases for the presence of a .env directory versus a .env file, ensuring the new correct behavior is covered by automated tests. Other files (such as __init__.py, app.py, or config.py) are not directly relevant to CLI dot-env auto-detection and user messaging for this specific bug.\"\n}",
