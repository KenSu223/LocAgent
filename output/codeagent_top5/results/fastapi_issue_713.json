The absence of body parameters in GET methods is most likely implemented or filtered here, so this file is the primary target for change.\\n2. fastapi/routing.py: Handles route definitions and registration. It may block GET requests with bodies at the application logic level; changes here could allow/describe bodies for GET.\\n3. fastapi/params.py: Involved in handling/defining parameter types including query, path, and body\u2014may need adjustment to support body for GET.\\n4. fastapi/param_functions.py: Contains logic for parsing and converting parameters at runtime; might need edits to permit/recognize request body for GET.\\n5. fastapi/openapi/models.py: The OpenAPI models may need to be updated to ensure bodies for GET requests are faithfully represented in the generated specification.'}",
