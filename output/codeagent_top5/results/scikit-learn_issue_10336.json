Changes to harmonize APIs\u2014such as adding `labels_`, a `fit_predict` method, and documentation supporting new behaviors\u2014must start here. This ensures all derived mixture classes follow the new conventions. 2. sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py: Contains the popular GaussianMixture class; its constructor parameters, the storage/exposure of `labels_` after training, and the implementation of `fit_predict` should be directly updated. 3. sklearn/mixture/gmm.py: Defines another key mixture class (GMM); would require the same changes as above for API alignment. 4. sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py: Contains Bayesian Gaussian Mixture and related classes, where similar modifications should be mirrored for API consistency. 5. doc/modules/mixture.rst: The documentation for mixture models should reflect the new interface, explain the role of `labels_` and `fit_predict`, and guide users on the updated conventions. Optionally, updates to clustering docs (`doc/modules/clustering.rst`) could further improve consistency, but are less essential to code/API changes in mixture models themselves.\"\n}",
