'localstack/services/sns/__init__.py' likely contains logic for initializing the SNS service, request routing, and potentially the point where topic name validation is enforced or needs change.\\n2. The 'localstack/services/sns/' directory contains the main implementation for SNS service operations including topic creation and should be inspected for model or handler definitions regulating validation or processing.\\n3. 'tests/integration/test_sns.py' must be updated to add/modify tests verifying that FIFO topics can be successfully created, reflecting the bugfix in integration scenarios.\\n4. 'tests/unit/test_sns.py' should be updated to ensure unit-level topic name validation and logic, confirming the fix (or add new test cases as necessary).\\nIf further granularity is needed, inspect all modules in the SNS directory for spread-out logic. These files cover both the backend enforcement, validation logic, and confirmation through testing.\"}",
