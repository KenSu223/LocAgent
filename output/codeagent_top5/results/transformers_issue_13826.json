The warning logic here must be revised so it matches the actual runtime behavior (i.e., does not warn unnecessarily). \\n2. src/transformers/tokenization_utils.py may need modification if similar logic or user-facing docs/warnings are duplicated among slow tokenizers or referenced by subclasses. 3. src/transformers/tokenization_utils_fast.py is next because it handles the fast tokenizers and might also refer or propagate the same logic for padding and max_length. 4. src/transformers/__init__.py is included if there is any API surface documentation that mentions or forwards arguments related to tokenizer padding/truncation (optional, but should be checked for consistency). 5. src/transformers/models/auto/tokenization_auto.py is where AutoTokenizer is defined and constructed. Though it is mostly a factory, if any default arguments or warnings are propagated at this level regarding padding/max_length interaction, they should be checked and updated for consistency. However, the primary and possibly only mandatory change is in tokenization_utils_base.py as proven by the traceback and direct warning evidence.\"\n}",
