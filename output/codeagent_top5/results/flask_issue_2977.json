Protection against duplicate/exclusive resource initialization (e.g. serial ports) in debug mode should be implemented here, possibly by only initializing when not in the reloader child process, or using a request-scoped/lazy approach. 2. flask/debughelpers.py: Contains helpers and exception logic specifically for debug mode, which may trigger or reinforce behaviors involving reload or duplicate init. 3. flask/wrappers.py: Handles app context and request file processing with debug checks, so resource management tied to requests may require changes here. 4. flask/config.py: Manages environment variables, including debug flags which affect how/when processes are spawned. Adapting configuration reading here may help users avoid pitfalls. 5. flask/cli.py: CLI and process runner logic, relevant to environment-specific launches and potentially to avoid resource re-initialization when using 'flask run' in development mode. These files together allow for robust protection, clear documentation, and safe patterns for exclusive resource initialization when debugging Flask apps.\"}",
