The code that raises ValueError on empty results must be modified to restore the previous behavior, allowing transform to return an empty object instead of failing.\\n\\n2. pandas/core/series.py: The Series.transform method is a thin wrapper that calls aggregation.transform. Adjustments may be needed for how transform is dispatched from Series, or documentation to clarify the correct behavior.\\n\\n3. pandas/tests/series/: Tests should be added or adjusted here to ensure .transform does not fail on empty Series/DataFrames and matches expected output, thus preventing regressions.\\n\\n4. pandas/core/apply.py: Since DataFrame/Series apply is still working as expected, checking this file ensures consistency between apply and transform, and may require a minor update if any shared dispatch logic exists.\\n\\n5. pandas/tests/test_aggregation.py: If there are general aggregation/transform tests, this file should have or be supplemented with a test for empty input to confirm .transform no longer throws on empty data.\"\n}",
