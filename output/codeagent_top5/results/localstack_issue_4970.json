Dockerfile.nodejs14x: Lambda runtime Dockerfile; misconfiguration here (wrong architecture, binary mismatch) is a common source of exec format error. 4. lambda_utils.py: Handles Lambda runtime resolution and handler file selection, which can determine the container's entrypoint and startup commands. 5. lambda_api.py: Orchestrates API-level Lambda invocation, feeds into the executor logic, and may need changes to tolerate/fix compatibility issues or configuration for Lambda invocations. Other files (cloudwatch_util.py, lambda_starter.py) are involved in logging and server setup, but less likely to need direct fixes for exec format errors.\"}",
