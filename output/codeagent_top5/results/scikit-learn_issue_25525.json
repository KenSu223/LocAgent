'sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py' contains the core implementation and docstring for SequentialFeatureSelector, and must document and correctly handle negative tol.\\n2. 'sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_sequential.py' already has direct tests for negative tol; updating/calibrating these ensures robust coverage.\\n3. 'examples/feature_selection/plot_select_from_model_diabetes.py' is a canonical example for feature selection and should demonstrate negative tol usage, especially in backward SFS cases.\\n4. 'examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_0_24_0.py' is for release notes and demos and should clearly show negative tol in the API highlight.\\n5. 'doc/modules/feature_selection.rst' is the user reference doc and should explicitly discuss and demonstrate usage of the tol parameter, including negative values.\"}",
