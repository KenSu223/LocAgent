It must be updated to handle Annotated and properly interpret its arguments for Depends, Query, Body, etc. 2. fastapi/params.py defines the Param, Depends, Query, Body classes and their base mechanisms, which need updating to integrate Annotated payloads. 3. fastapi/param_functions.py provides factories/interfaces for Depends, Query, and Body and may need adjustments for signature handling and Annotated support. 4. fastapi/routing.py is responsible for registering endpoints and processing their dependency signatures; it should be updated to support the Annotated forms. 5. fastapi/applications.py manages application-level dependencies and would need modification to accept and process dependencies specified via Annotated.'}",
