These operations are handled in the run_qa.py and run_squad.py scripts, which contain the training loop and finalization logic. Modifications here can add error handling, fix logic errors, or diagnose file-system/connection issues that occur at job completion. Focusing on these files will address bugs that happen after training finishes, as described in the user's issue.\"}",
