This file handles CLI startup logic and imports dotenv in a try/except block, indicating it handles optional support for environment files. The warning is triggered even when .env is a directory, suggesting that flask/cli.py incorrectly checks for the existence of \\\".env\\\" without verifying that it is a file and not a directory. Modifying flask/cli.py to ensure it only warns about .env files\u2014not directories\u2014will fix the reported issue.\"\n}",
