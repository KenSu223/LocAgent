However, the typing restriction causing the mypy error is likely enforced in src/flask/app.py, where the template_filter decorator is implemented or used. The decorator's type hint for the filter argument probably restricts it to a function accepting a single argument (Callable[[Any], str]) instead of the more flexible TemplateFilterCallable. Modifying the type hints in src/flask/app.py to use TemplateFilterCallable will resolve this issue, allowing custom filters that take multiple arguments.\"\n}",
