The core S3 request handling is implemented in s3_listener.py, which would be responsible for parsing PUT requests, extracting headers, storing metadata along with objects, and returning metadata in headObject responses. Missing or incorrect metadata handling needs to be fixed in this file so that it processes x-amz-meta-* headers from PUT requests and attaches them to objects appropriately.\"\n}",
