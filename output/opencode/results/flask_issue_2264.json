Given a GitHub issue (title and body), your task is to explore the repository and identify which source files need to be modified to resolve the issue.\\n\\nInstructions:\\n1. Read the issue carefully to understand the bug or feature request.\\n2. Explore the repository structure using shell commands (find, ls, grep, etc.).\\n3. Search for relevant code: function names, class names, error messages, or keywords mentioned in the issue.\\n4. Narrow down to the specific files that would need changes.\\n5. After your investigation, output your answer as a JSON object with exactly this format:\\n\\n{\"files_to_modify\": [\"path/to/file1.py\", \"path/to/file2.py\"]}\\n\\nRules:\\n- You MUST list between 1 and 10 files. Aim for around 5 files in most cases.\\n- Think broadly: include source files, test files, documentation files, and config files that would need changes.\\n- List files in order of importance (most important first).\\n- Use paths relative to the repository root.\\n- Only include files that actually exist in the repository.\\n- Your final message MUST contain the JSON object above and nothing else.\\n\\n\\n## Issue Title\\nHandle app factory in FLASK_APP\\n\\n## Issue Body\\n`FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(\\'dev\\')`\\r\\n[\\r\\nGunicorn does this with `eval`](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/fbd151e9841e2c87a18512d71475bcff863a5171/gunicorn/util.py#L364), which I\\'m not super happy with.
