It must be modified to propagate SPHINXOPTS and plot_gallery=0 reliably for all build commands, fixing the logic so that --no-plot works as intended.\\n2. doc/conf.py: This file sets the runtime configuration for documentation, including Sphinx-Gallery. It should read plot_gallery from build options or environment and configure sphinx_gallery accordingly, thereby actually controlling example execution.\\n3. doc/sphinxext/move_gallery_links.py: If any custom gallery code is used or output is altered here, this file may also need updates to respect the gallery enable/disable logic. Other files (top-level Makefile and generic Sphinx extensions) have negligible impact for this issue.'}",
