This is a significant feature that requires changes to the blueprint system, app registration, and scaffold base class. Predicted files: (1) src/flask/blueprints.py - the blueprint implementation that needs nesting support. (2) src/flask/app.py - app-level blueprint registration. (3) src/flask/scaffold.py - base class for app and blueprints. (4) CHANGES.rst - changelog entry for the new feature. (5) tests/test_blueprints.py - blueprint tests. Exploration: All three source files are involved in the blueprint system. Matched src/flask/blueprints.py -> tests/test_blueprints.py.",
