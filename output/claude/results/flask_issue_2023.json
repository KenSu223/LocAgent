  "raw_output": "Issue 2023 discusses redesigning Flask's logging setup. Flask's hardcoded logging handler makes it difficult to install custom logging setups. The fix involves modifying flask/logging.py (the logging module) and flask/app.py (where the logger is set up on the app). Predicted files: (1) flask/logging.py - the logging module that sets up default handlers. (2) flask/app.py - where app.logger is configured and the logging setup is triggered. (3) CHANGES - changelog entry for the logging redesign. (4) tests/test_basic.py - basic app tests that cover logging behavior (logging tests for app.py are in test_basic.py). Exploration: Identified both logging.py and app.py as affected files. Note there is no dedicated test_logging.py at this commit, so tests/test_basic.py covers logging behavior.",
