  "raw_output": "Issue 1971 proposes implementing RFC 7233 (HTTP Range Requests) in Flask's send_file method. The send_file function is in flask/helpers.py and would need modification to support Range request headers. Predicted files: (1) flask/helpers.py - contains send_file() which needs Range Request support. (2) CHANGES - changelog entry for the new feature. (3) tests/test_helpers.py - tests for send_file live in test_helpers.py. Exploration: The issue explicitly mentions modifying send_file, which is in helpers.py. Test file mapping: flask/helpers.py -> tests/test_helpers.py.",
