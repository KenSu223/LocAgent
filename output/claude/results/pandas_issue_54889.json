Enforcing or correcting the dependency order here will directly address the race condition between .pxi generation and .pyx compilation.\\n2. generate_pxi.py: This script is responsible for processing .pxi.in files to .pxi; improvements in locking, robustness, or output signaling may be required.\\n3. meson.build (root): If additional orchestration or top-level dependency enforcement is needed to serialize build steps, modifications may be necessary here.\\n4. pandas/_libs/window/meson.build: This Meson file handles Cython module builds for 'window' extensions. It should be reviewed and modified if race conditions affect dependencies there.\\n5. pandas/_libs/tslibs/meson.build: As with window, this file manages Cython extension builds for timeseries code, and should be checked for race condition risk in extension compilation order.\"}",
