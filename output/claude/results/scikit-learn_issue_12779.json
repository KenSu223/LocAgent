They are prioritized as follows: 1. _pilutil.py: Used for image utilities (fundamental for many ML pipelines involving images). 2. joblib/_dask.py: Handles parallel computations (core for efficient model training/evaluation). 3. joblib/parallel.py: Key for parallelism (widely used throughout scikit-learn for performance). 4. joblib/memory.py: Manages memory caching (central in high-performance settings/de-duplication). 5. joblib/logger.py: Contributes to logging in parallel jobs (critical for diagnostics and debugging). Removing legacy __future__ imports modernizes these commonly used modules and prevents unnecessary compatibility code. Lower-level or external vendor files (e.g., cloudpickle, loky) may be less critical but could be addressed later.\"}",
