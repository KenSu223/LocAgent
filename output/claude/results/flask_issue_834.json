  "raw_output": "Issue 834 asks about getting the serialized version of the session cookie in Flask 0.10. The fix involves the session handling code in flask/sessions.py. Predicted files: (1) flask/sessions.py - the session module that handles cookie serialization. (2) CHANGES - changelog entry for the fix. Exploration: Matched flask/sessions.py as the core file. No test_sessions.py exists at this very early commit (base_commit 2d8a21c), and no test files directory was found, so only the source file and changelog are predicted.",
