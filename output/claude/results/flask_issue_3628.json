The fix is in the make_response or response handling logic in app.py. Predicted files: (1) src/flask/app.py - contains make_response() and response processing. (2) CHANGES.rst - changelog entry for the bug fix. (3) tests/test_basic.py - basic app tests that cover response handling behavior. Exploration: Matched src/flask/app.py -> tests/test_basic.py for test coverage.",
