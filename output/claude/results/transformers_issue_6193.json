Changes here would ensure that 'position_ids' and 'lm_head.decoder.bias' are registered, loaded, and handled correctly as part of checkpoint loading.\\n2. src/transformers/modeling_utils.py: Contains the logic for loading pretrained weights, detecting missing weights, and logging warnings. Modifications may be needed to ensure proper registration, detection, and loading of buffers such as position_ids and decoder.bias.\\n3. src/transformers/models/roberta/modeling_bert.py: RoBERTa inherits from Bert, so embedding or buffer registration logic missing from RoBERTa may need to be ported or corrected here.\\n4. examples/language-modeling/run_language_modeling.py: Entry point for evaluation as described in the issue. Minor changes may be needed to ensure it works with any model instantiation fixes, handle warnings, or test proper initialization.\"}",
