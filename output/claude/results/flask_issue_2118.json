  "raw_output": "Issue 2118 reports that config.from_pyfile crashes on Python 3 when the source file isn't encoded in the default encoding (e.g., gbk). The fix is to open the file in binary mode ('rb'). Predicted files: (1) flask/config.py - contains from_pyfile() method that needs the fix. (2) CHANGES - changelog entry for the bug fix. (3) tests/test_config.py - config-related tests that would need a test case for non-default encoding. Exploration: Matched flask/config.py -> tests/test_config.py for test coverage.",
