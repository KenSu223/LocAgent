  "raw_output": "Issue 4015 reports that Flask 2.0.0 build requires ContextVar module, which implies a Python version constraint issue in the setup configuration. Predicted files: (1) setup.cfg - build configuration with Python version requirements. (2) CHANGES.rst - changelog entry. (3) setup.py - additional setup configuration. Exploration: This is a build/packaging issue, so test files are less relevant. The fix involves updating python_requires or dependency specifications in setup files.",
