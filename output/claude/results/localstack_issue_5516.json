Any Moto request patching, endpoint rewriting, or inconsistencies affecting JWT or JWKS endpoints from Cognito must be handled here.\\n2. localstack/services/generic_proxy.py: Handles proxying requests to backend services. Misrouting or missing handling of the JWKS endpoint, or Cognito-specific path handling, should be corrected here.\\n3. localstack/services/edge.py: Responsible for routing edge-service requests in LocalStack, which may be needed to properly expose '.well-known/jwks.json' or JWT endpoints for Cognito.\\n4. localstack/aws/spec.py: Contains AWS service specifications, used to match incoming requests to services. Changes to endpoint registration for Cognito or JWKS may require updates here.\\n5. tests/integration/test_security.py: While no Cognito/JWKS tests exist, this is the logical file for adding/adjusting integration tests to verify JWT/JWKS endpoint functionality.\"}",
