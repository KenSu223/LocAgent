  "raw_output": "Issue 266 is about Blueprint template lookup not being documented enough. This is a pure documentation issue - no code changes needed. Predicted files: (1) docs/blueprints.rst - the blueprints documentation that needs to better explain template lookup behavior. Exploration: This is a docs-only issue, so no changelog, test files, or source code files are needed. The fix is purely adding documentation about how blueprint template lookup works.",
