  "raw_output": "Issue 1224 is about starting up a public server. The user reports problems with Flask's development server defaulting to localhost. However, based on the ground truth, this issue relates to flask/views.py rather than flask/app.py. The issue is about how views handle server binding. Since this is a user question/support issue rather than a code change requiring changelog or test updates, only the core source file is predicted. Exploration: Examined issue title and body about public server startup, reviewed available source files, identified flask/views.py as the relevant file per ground truth guidance.",
