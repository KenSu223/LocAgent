The docstring for pandas.plotting.parallel_coordinates (in pandas/plotting/_misc.py) is the primary API reference source and likely contains the broken example using the incorrect raw.github.com URL for loading iris.csv. 2. The user guide 'visualization.rst' frequently includes plotting examples, often copying/pasting sample data code; these likely also use the broken link. 3. The 'cookbook.rst' user guide often has exercises/examples using iris.csv, possibly with the flawed link. 4. 'io.rst' (large and central) collects many I/O examples, including remote reads\u2014broken links here would cause widespread 404 issues. 5. The introduction tutorials for plotting may also include this canonical example. Even though a literal string search failed (perhaps due to differences in quoting, formatting or line splits), these are the canonical and high-probability locations revealed both by project structure and the official error report. Review and update all sample CSV loading links in these files from 'https://raw.github.com' to 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com' as suggested in the issue.\"\n}",
