  "raw_output": "Issue 1749 reports that Flask's JSONEncoder ignores timezone information on datetime objects, converting them to timetuple which loses timezone data. The fix would modify the default() method in JSONEncoder in flask/json.py to properly handle timezone-aware datetimes. Predicted files: (1) flask/json.py - contains the JSONEncoder class that needs fixing to handle aware datetimes. (2) CHANGES - changelog entry documenting the datetime encoding fix. (3) tests/test_helpers.py - JSON-related tests are in test_helpers.py. Exploration: Identified flask/json.py as the core file, matched it to tests/test_helpers.py for test file mapping, added CHANGES for the changelog.",
