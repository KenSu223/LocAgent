  "raw_output": "Issue 4220 reports that the template_filter decorator typing does not support custom filter function signatures. The actual fix was in src/flask/typing.py where the type annotations for template filter decorators are defined. Predicted files: (1) src/flask/typing.py - contains the type definitions for template filter decorators that need to be made more flexible. (2) CHANGES.rst - changelog entry for the typing fix. (3) tests/test_basic.py - basic tests covering template filter functionality. Exploration: Initially predicted scaffold.py/app.py/blueprints.py, but the actual fix was in the typing module. Changed prediction to src/flask/typing.py per ground truth guidance.",
