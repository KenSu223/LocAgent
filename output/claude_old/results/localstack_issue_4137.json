Swapping to Kinesis-Mock requires core changes here. 2. install.py: Contains specific installation routines and CLI paths for Kinesalite; needs updating to support Kinesis-Mock across the codebase. 3. kinesis_listener.py: Emulates Kinesalite's API and responses, which will differ for Kinesis-Mock, thereby necessitating significant logic changes. 4. config.py: Contains configuration relevant to the mock's behavior, including resource limits and delays; should be updated to reflect Kinesis-Mock options. 5. kinesis_connector.py: Includes interoperability and edge case handling that was written with Kinesalite in mind; may require updates for compatibility with Kinesis-Mock.\"}",
