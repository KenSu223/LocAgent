It likely contains the logic for get-parameter and get-parameters, and needs to be fixed to accept ARNs as valid parameter names and bypass overly strict validation.\\n2. __init__.py may define service initialization or registration, and could import or initialize validation logic that also needs updating if provider.py changes require it.\\n3. resource_providers/ may have supporting logic for parameter retrieval, especially if ARNs are mapped to storage keys or need special handling \u2013 these files may need updates for full feature parity and/or to support ARN lookups.\\n4. stores.py is a generic utility for service data storage and may contain generic validation or error handling that interacts with SSM; validation logic may need changes here if it is centralized.\\n5. test_validate.py is in the tests directory for AWS services, where parameter name validation is tested. Updating or adding tests here will ensure the new ARN-supportive logic is verified and future regressions are prevented.\"\n}",
