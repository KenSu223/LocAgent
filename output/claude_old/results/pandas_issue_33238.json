'pandas/io/sas/sas.pyx': This file generates massive DeprecationWarnings due to use of `tostring()` in the SAS parser; it should be changed to use `tobytes()` for compatibility and to resolve pipeline timeouts, making it the top priority. 2. 'pandas/_libs/writers.pyx': Contains a deprecated `tostring()` usage that may also contribute warnings/errors in data IO routines. 3. 'pandas/core/computation/pytables.py': Has two distinct `tostring()` usages (method and function); updating them is important for futureproofing, although these are less likely the cause of the mass timeout. The other file ('pandas/io/parquet.py') only mentions the warning in a comment and does not require changes.\"}",
