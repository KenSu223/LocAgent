Adjust port/network config if inter-container comms are needed.\\n2. localstack/config.py: Ensure environment variable handling and service exposure logic allow for Docker network binding (using BIND_HOST or docker network alias instead of 'localhost').\\n3. localstack/constants.py: Ensure config (BIND_HOST or LOCALHOST usage) allows external connections by default in Docker/CI, not just 'localhost'.\\n4. Dockerfile: Verify that no networking or local-only settings prevent Docker service exposure and check for correct installation/entrypoint setup.\\n5. localstack/services/kinesis/: Inspect code for service setup to ensure it does not hardcode host/port improperly and uses the correct environment or config settings for service interface binding.\"}",
