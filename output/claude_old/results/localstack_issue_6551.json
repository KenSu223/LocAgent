If SSM and SecretsManager use separate stores, integration/fix may be required here for unified lookup.\\n4. localstack/services/providers.py: Likely wires up the service implementations and may need changes for cross-service lookup or error handling improvements relevant to the bug.\\n5. localstack/aws/gateway.py: Routes API requests to service handlers. It may require patching if the bug is related to improper dispatch or translation of get-parameter calls across services.\"}",
