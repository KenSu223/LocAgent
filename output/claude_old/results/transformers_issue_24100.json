This file contains the ProgressCallback class and is responsible for the creation and configuration of tqdm progress bars during training. Adding the argument dynamic_ncols=True to the tqdm invocation here will ensure the progress bar dynamically resizes when the terminal size changes, addressing the specific problem described in the issue. No other files directly handle the progress bar logic or callback configuration for tqdm, so only this file modification is necessary.\"\n}",
