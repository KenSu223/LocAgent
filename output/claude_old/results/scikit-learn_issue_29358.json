Updating the list, criteria, or links for sprints must be done here. 2. doc/conf.py \u2014 Might require updates if you want to pull sprint info or links from external sites, automate inclusion, or configure references to a new sprint listing file. 3. doc/images/ \u2014 Sponsor or sprint images shown on the About page are sourced from here; needed if updating/adding images. 4. doc/README.md \u2014 If contributor documentation about how to list new sprints is updated, update the README to guide them. 5. doc/sprints.rst \u2014 Not present yet, but as a potential fix, creating a dedicated file for sprints is recommended for systematic future updates and detailed records, with links from about.rst and blog.'}",
