Dockerfile: Needs a HEALTHCHECK instruction querying the new health endpoint, informing Docker Compose of LocalStack health. 3. localstack/services/infra.py: Ties health status to readiness logic, so the endpoint reflects true service state. 4. README.md: Update documentation to inform users about the healthcheck feature and Docker Compose setup. 5. bin/localstack: May need minor updates if startup or CLI should expose health diagnostics or if control over health signaling is required.'}",
