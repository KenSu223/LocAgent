To change behavior so that datetime index labels (when unique) can be accessed via [] (not just .loc), the logic must be updated here\u2014perhaps in __getitem__ or in the resolution between columns and index labels.\\n\"\n        + \"2. pandas/core/generic.py: Contains NDFrame base class and _get_item_cache, which is called by DataFrame.__getitem__ for key resolution and caching. If handling of keys\u2014including distinguishing index labels from columns\u2014is to be improved, adjustments here will be needed.\\n\"\n        + \"3. pandas/core/indexing.py: This file contains .loc and .iloc implementations, specialized logic for index-based selection. To harmonize [] and .loc behaviors for datetime indices, it's important to ensure consistency and possibly reuse loc logic for __getitem__.\\n\"\n        + \"4. pandas/core/index.py: Holds the Index and DatetimeIndex classes. Any changes in how DataFrame resolves columns vs. index labels (especially for DatetimeIndex) might depend on special-casing or helper method additions here to accurately detect and handle index lookups.\\n\"\n        + \"5. pandas/core/internals.py: Manages BlockManager, which underlies the column retrieval, and contains the methods get, _find_block, and _check_have referenced in the stack trace. If key access logic is to switch to index lookups when column match fails, BlockManager might need interface updates to support this fallback gracefully.\"\n}",
