Modification here could expose a public method or utility (e.g., SecureCookieSessionInterface.get_serialized_cookie_value(session, app)) allowing retrieval of the serialized session cookie value after login, resolving the exact issue described by the user\u2014a lack of an equivalent to flask.session.serialize() in v0.10. \\n2. flask/app.py: This file maintains the Flask app object and its configuration, including the session interface. Changes may be required to expose the new serialization method at the application/session API layer to developers, or to add helper functions or properties (such as an app.session.serialize() property). \\n3. flask/__init__.py: This file is responsible for package imports and shortcuts; it may need updating to document and expose any new or modified public session API methods introduced, ensuring developers can easily discover and use the new session serialization access point.\\nOther files are not directly relevant unless documentation or tests are to be updated.\"\n}",
