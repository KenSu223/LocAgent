The Polygon class, found in topics/geometry.py, is ultimately responsible for setting up the points array in constructs like 'self.triangle = Polygon(...)' in old_projects/triangle_of_power/triangle.py. Modifying Polygon's __init__ in topics/geometry.py to always cast its points array to float (e.g., using np.array(points, dtype=float)) will ensure all polygons (and their descendants) work with geometric transformations, resolving this and similar issues across the codebase. Only topics/geometry.py needs to be modified; triangle.py and core VMobject code expect correct dtype in subclasses/instances.\"\n}",
